**Present at the meeting after training on 22-23 September 2016**

## Discussion

- convert to python 3
- split course into beginner/intermediate/advance
- other python libraries to cover like pandas
- course feedbacks

**Convert to Python 3** — for sure
- BioPython, pandas all migrated
- anaconda is 3 by default

**Add linux command introduction** — basic command and tree representation; it is essential to run python from a script on the command line

**Better introduction** — on why we use python in a notebook, on the command line and in file explaining how we run things

**Contents to drop**
- file I/O should stay but remove reading XML/PDB format only keep delimited files and maybe JSON
- drop system call
- drop exceptions

**Contents to add**
- way of searching into python library documentation for string
- independent learners
- bonus exercise — use pandas to parse this file to keep them busy
- add BioPython exercise for the reverse complement function by writing second function using BioPython doing the same thing

**Contents to re-arrange**
- restructure the second day
- section 4 (1) file then (2) command line
- move functions before section 2

**How to better stimulate the learner**
- better explanation on how to solve each exercises by splitting problems into smaller chunks
  - (1) explain how to solve an exercise by starting with a blank page and comments to divide the problem in small chunks
  - (2) search for solution on internet either on forum or in python library
  - (3) program together using functions to solve exercises
- better manage expectations by being clearer on objectives
- build connected exercises not disconnected ones, build upon learning — start simple and increase complexity
- write code in group of 2 or 3; one function each to solve one bigger problem; explain and make them sure to write together a bigger program; then exchange code and progress to next level
- bring your questions

## Actions

> Meeting once a month — to get running.

**Next course** — December 16
- Keep exercises for sure
- Minimize the lecture part
- Make them search for solution
- Assignment — like workshop couple of urls
- Create 3 levels of exercises beginner/intermediate/advance

**Checklists for December course**
- [ ] Anne to re-organize course and add BioPython exercise
- [ ] Tomás to convert code to Python 3
- [ ] Christian to correct typos

Christian sent his feedback by email — exceptions and reading PDB and XML files is too advanced for a beginner course.
There are a few typos in the course that I can correct if somebody tells me how.
